# Thank You!

## Providing Feedback

We truly appreciate your time and efforts to review FortiGate CNF and value your feedback greatly. Please take the time to capture your thoughts on:

1.  What do you like about the FortiGate CNF solution. Does anything beneficial stand out in comparison to the competition?

2.  What room for improvement do you see in the solution. Is there anything we are missing that the competition has or companies are asking for but no solution exists on the market?

3.  For any issues or enhancements, please capture screenshots and provide as much detail as possible. What specific problem or use case does the enhancement solve?

4.  What are your thoughts on using FortiManager to manage policy and objects vs having all items in the FortiGate CNF portal? Any pros/cons for leaning heavy towards one side or is parity expected by customers?
