	"content": "Distributed Ingress For this traffic flow we will focus on the Application VPC. Distributed ingress is commonly used when there is a need to inspect traffic for a VPC that is directly accessible with an attached IGW and resources with a public Elastic IP (EIP) or behind a public load balancer (ie ALB, NLB, etc). The benefit of this design is that traffic does not need to traverse additional AWS networking components for inspection so each VPC is isolated from others. The caveat to consider is that each VPC would need a directly attached IGW and resources such as load balancers, NAT GWs, etc that have additional cost.\nStep 1: An inbound connection starts with an external user initiating a connection to a public resource such as a public NLB. The public NLB has a DNS record that resolves to a public IP for one of the NLB\u0026rsquo;s Elastic Network Interface (ENI) in either public subnet. The first packet (ie TCP SYN) will then be seen at the IGW attached to the VPC where the public NLB is deployed. Since there is a Ingress route table assigned to the IGW, traffic destined to either public subnet will be sent to the GWLBe endpoint in the same AZ.\nThe IGW will perform destination NAT to change the public IP of the NLB to the private IP of the NLB ENI.\n Step 2: The traffic is received at the GWLBe endpoint which then routes the traffic to the associated GWLB ENI in the same AZ in the managed Fortinet AWS account/VPC. This is done behind the scene using AWS Private Link.\nStep 3: The traffic is received at the GWLB ENI and is then encapsulated in a GENEVE tunnel and routed to one of the instances in the FortiGate CNF auto scale group for traffic inspection. Post inspection, if the traffic is allowed, the instance will hairpin the traffic back to the same GWLB ENI over GENEVE. Then the GWLB ENI will hairpin the traffic back to the same GWLBe endpoint.\nStep 4: The GWLBe endpoint will then route the inspected traffic to the intrinsic router. The intrinsic router will route traffic directly to the NLB\u0026rsquo;s ENI as specified in the VPC route table assigned to the subnet.\nStep 5: The NLB will send traffic to a healthy target, in either AZ since cross zone load balancing is enabled.\nThe NLB will perform destination NAT to change the private IP to that of the healthy target.\n Step 6: The web server will receive the traffic and respond. The return traffic will flow these steps in reverse.\n   To test out this flow navigate to the AWS CloudFormation console and toggle the view nested button to off \u0026gt; then select the stack name \u0026gt; and on the details pane select the outputs tab. You should see the output for URLforApp1. Click on the value for that output to check that App1 is no longer reachable now. Click on the value for the output EncryptedURLforApp1 and you will see the self-signed certificate warning. Once you accept the warning, you will see the test web page.    You are now only allowing HTTPS inbound to your environment that is sourced from a public IP within the United States!\n "

	"content": "AWS Networking Concepts Before diving into the reference architecture for this workshop, let\u0026rsquo;s review core AWS networking concepts.\nAWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network that you define. You have complete control over your virtual networking environment, including selection of your own IP address range, creation of subnets, and configuration of route tables and network gateways.\nAvailability zones (AZ) are multiple, isolated locations within each Region that have independent power, cooling, physical security, etc. A VPC spans all of the AZs in the Region.\nRegion, is a collection of multiple regional AZs in a geographic location. The collection of AZs in the same region are all interconnected via redundant, ultra-low-latency networks.\nAll subnets within a VPC are able to reach each other with the default or intrinsic router within the VPC. All resources in a subnet use the intrinsic router (1st host IP in each subnet) as the default gateway. Each subnet must be associated with a VPC route table, which specifies the allowed routes for outbound traffic leaving the subnet.\nAn Internet Gateway (IGW) is a horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC component that allows communication between instances in your VPC and the internet. It therefore imposes no availability risks or bandwidth constraints on your network traffic.\nAWS NAT Gateway (NAT GW) is a Network Address Translation (NAT) service. You can use a NAT gateway so that instances in a private subnet can connect to services outside your VPC but external services cannot initiate a connection with those instances.\nAWS Transit Gateway (TGW) is a highly scalable cloud router that connects your VPCs in the same region to each other, to on-premise networks, and even to the internet through one hub. With the use of multiple route tables for a single TGW, you can design hub and spoke routing for traffic inspection and enforcement of security policy across multiple VPCs.\nAWS (Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB) is a transparent network gateway that distributes traffic (in a 3/5 tuple flow aware manner) to a fleet of virtual appliances for inspection. This is a regional load balancer that uses GWLB endpoints (GWLBe) to securely intercept data plane traffic within consumer VPCs in the same region.\nIn this workshop we will use all these components to test FortiGate CNF in an enterprise design.\n"

	"content": "AWS Common Architecture Patterns While there are many ways to organize your infrastructure there are two main ways to design your networking when using GWLB, centralized and distributed. From the perspective of networking, routing, and GWLBe placement. We will discuss this further below.\nFortiGate CNF is a SaaS offering that on the backend uses FortiGates, AWS GWLB, and GWLB endpoints to intercept customer traffic and inspect this transparently. As part of the deployment process for FortiGate CNF instances, the customer environment will need to implement VPC and ingress routing at the IGW to intercept the traffic to be inspected.\nThe FortiGate CNF security stack which includes the AWS GWLB and other components will deployed in Fortinet managed AWS accounts. The details of the diagram are simply an example of the main components used in FortiGate CNF. This is more to understand what happens when customer traffic is received at our GWLB.\nDecentralized designs do not require any routing between the protected VPC and another VPC through TGW. These designs allow simple service insertion with minimal routing changes to the VPC route table. The yellow numbers show the initial packet flow for a session and how it is routed (using ingress and VPC routes) to the GWLBe endpoint which then sends traffic to the FortiGate CNF stack. The blue numbers show the returned traffic after inspection by the FortiGate CNF stack.\nNote: Any subnet where the GWLBe for the FortiGate CNF instance is to be deployed will need to have a specific tag name and value to be seen in the FortiGate CNF portal. Currently this is the tag name \u0026lsquo;fortigatecnf_subnet_type\u0026rsquo; and tag value \u0026lsquo;endpoint\u0026rsquo;.\nCentralized designs require the use of TGW to provide a simple hub and spoke architecture to inspect traffic. These can simplify east-west and egress traffic inspection needs while removing the need for IGWs and NAT Gateways to be deployed in each protected VPC for egress inspection. You can still mix a decentralized architecture to inspect ingress and even egress traffic while leveraging the centralized design for all east-west inspection.\nThe yellow numbers show the initial packet flow for a session and how it is routed (using ingress, VPC routes, and TGW routes) to the GWLBe which then sends traffic to the FortiGate CNF stack. The blue numbers (east-west) and purple numbers (egress) show the returned traffic after inspection by the FortiGate CNF stack.\nFor more examples of distributed and centralized models, please reference the examples on the FortiGate CNF Admin Guide.\n"

	"tags": [],
	"description": "",
	"content": "Centralized Egress For this traffic flow we will focus on the Shared Services, Workload, and Inspection VPCs. Centralized egress is commonly used when there is a strong desire to control egress traffic through a common set of NAT GWs in an egress or what we call an Inspection VPC. The benefit of this design is that you only need NAT GWs in the Inspection VPC (one per AZ) vs every VPC (one per AZ), which have an hourly cost. The caveat of this design is traffic will traverse additional AWS networking components for inspection (ie TGW, etc) that will have additional cost.\nStep 1: An outbound connection starts with a private EC2 instance initiating a connection to a public resource.

Login to the instance with the instance ID as the username and Fortinet123! as the password. Then run the commands below to test traffic:    ping 8.8.8.8\ncurl http://ipinfo.io\ncurl https://ipinfo.io\nYou are now only allowing HTTPS outbound to one FQDN and ICMP to any public IP within the United States!\n   Question 1: What happens if you try the same test from SSInstance1?   You should be able to access the IPinfo.io site over HTTPS and ping any public IP within the United States.\n    Question 2: What address objects are allowing this communication to work even though the sdn-group = group3 for this instance?   AppPublicSubnet1 + AppPublicSubnet2. Remember that Dynamic, FQDN, and standard address objects still resolve to IPs. Since the Application-VPC and SharedServices-VPC share the same CIDR the data plane traffic will match on those Address objects.\nA solution to this would be to use multiple CNF Instances in a region or expand on your tagging strategy to make the objects be more specific while avoiding using broad subnet CIDR values in the same L4 rule.\n  "

Then you can select and edit it to deploy endpoints and assign a policy set.      On the Configure Endpoints section of the wizard, click the New button. Then you can select the account, VPC, then toggle the Select from all subnets to off (this filters the subnets to only show ones that are properly tagged), and the subnet to deploy the VPC endpoint to.

The subnet needs a Tag Name = fortigatecnf_subnet_type and Tag Value = endpoint. Otherwise you will see an error that the subnet ID is invalid. The subnets below have already been tagged properly. In this example environment, the subnets above have already been properly tagged.\n   On the Configure Policy Set section of the wizard, use the default \u0026lsquo;allow_all\u0026rsquo; policy to allow all traffic from a Layer 4 perspective and click Finalize to push that default policy. You should then see the list of CNF instances again.      To validate all GWLBe endpoints have been deployed and are active (takes ~5 mins), select and edit the CNF instance and click Next to view the GWLBe endpoints on the Configure Endpoints section of the wizard. Then click Exit to leave the CNF configuration wizard.      Log into your AWS Account and navigate to the VPC Console \u0026gt; Endpoints. Each of the GWLBe endpoints you deployed in the FortiGate CNF Console should be visible in your account. Notice the tag name and value pairs assigned to the endpoints.    Note: At this point in a normal environment, you would need to create ingress and VPC routes to direct traffic to the GWLBe endpoints that were created by FortiGate CNF for inspection. However, for this workshop there is a Lambda function that is creating these routes for you to match the AWS Reference Architecture Diagram.\n   To validate that the relevant VPC routes have been automatically created to route traffic to the GWLBe endpoints, in the AWS VPC console, navigate to Virtual Private Cloud \u0026gt; Route Tables, select each of the route tables listed below and confirm these routes exist in the route tab of the route table details pane.

You should see the output for URLforApp1. Click on the value for that output to check that App1 is reachable now. You should see a simple webpage with some metadata about the backend web server instance that is reachable via the public Network Load Balancer (NLB).      This concludes this section.    "

Then run the commands below to test traffic:    ping 10.1.2.10\nssh ec2-user@10.1.2.10\ncurl -k https://10.1.2.10\nYou are now only allowing HTTPS and RADIUS access between two resourced based on metadata (ie Tags)!\n   Question 1: What happens if you try the same test from WrkInstance1?   You are able to ping but SS annd HTTPS time out.\n    Question 2: What tags are allowing this communication to match the dynamic address objects?   For the ProdAPIBackend object, Tag.env=prod AND Tag.app-role=api AND Tag.app-tier=backend. For the ProdAuthBackend object, Tag.env=prod AND Tag.app-role=auth AND Tag.app-tier=backend.\n  "

	"content": "Task 4: Create a policy set and apply it to a FortiGate CNF Instance    At this point, we are using the default allow_all policy set which allows all communication to be allowed without any restriction from a Layer 4 and Layer 7 perspective.      To customize the actual L4 rules and L7 security profile groups applied, in the FortiGate CNF Console navigate to Policy \u0026amp; Objects \u0026gt; Policy Sets to create your own policy set. Simply click Create New, select Policy Set, and give your policy set a name.      Before adding in L4 rules within the policy set, create a few simple address objects. Navigate to Policy \u0026amp; Objects \u0026gt; Addresses, click New, and Address. Then create each of the address objects below.       Name Type IP/Netmask Value     ClassA Subnet 10.0.0.0/8   ClassB Subnet 172.16.0.0/12   ClassC Subnet 192.168.0.0/16   GooglePublicDNS1 Subnet 8.8.8.8/32   GooglePublicDNS2 Subnet 8.8.4.4/32   AppPublicSubnet1 Subnet 10.1.1.0/24   AppPublicSubnet2 Subnet 10.1.2.0/24      Next, create an Address Group to include all the RFC 1918 class objects. On the same page, click New, and Address Group. Then create each the address object below.       Name Members Value     RFC-1918 ClassA, ClassB, ClassC      In FortiGate CNF you can create different types of address objects to be more flexible and granular in your rules within your policy set. Create an FQDN based address object by clicking New, and Address. Select FQDN for Type, then create the address object below.    Note: This can be used for internal Application, Network, and even legacy Elastic Load Balancers (ie ALB, NLB, ELB) to dynamically resolve their private IPs.\n    Name Type FQDN Value     ipinfo.io FQDN ipinfo.io      Geography based address objects are available in FortiGate CNF. This allows controlling traffic based on public IPs assigned to countries around the globe. These objects can be used as a source or destination object within policies used in a policy set. Create a geo based address object by clicking New, and Address. Select Geography for Type, then create the address objects below.    Note: The IP for the country or region is automatically determined from the Geography IP database which is provided by FortiGuard Servers on a recurring basis. For more granular control to applications (especially external), it is recommended to use URL or DNS filtering and even Application Control for L7 inspection.\n    Name Type Country/Region Value     UnitedStates Geography United States   Russia Geography Russian Federation      Dynamic metadata based address objects are available in FortiGate CNF. This allows controlling of traffic based on things such as VPC ID, Auto Scale Group, EKS Cluster or Pod, and even Tag Name + Value pairs for a given AWS account and region. Create a dynamic based address object by clicking New, and Address. Select Dynamic for Type, then create the address objects below.    Note: This is using AWS API calls behind the scenes such as ec2:DescribeInstances, eks:ListClusters, eks:DescribeCluster, etc. For instances, these must be running to have their IP address(es) (public and or private IPs) returned.\n Note: For each object, you will use the same values for these settings:\n   Type AWS Account ID AWS Region     Dynamic Workshop-AWS-Account-ID us-east-2    Here is the list of dynamic objects to create:\n   Name SDN Address Type Filter Value     ProdAPIBackend Private Tag.env=prod AND Tag.app-role=api AND Tag.app-tier=backend   ProdAuthBackend Private Tag.env=prod AND Tag.app-role=auth AND Tag.app-tier=backend   SDNGroup1 Private Tag.sdn-group=group1   SDNGroup2 Private Tag.sdn-group=group2   SDNGroup3 Private Tag.sdn-group=group3      Now you will create a policy set to enforce L4 rules using the address objects you just created in the previous steps. Navigate to Policy \u0026amp; Objects \u0026gt; Policy Sets and click New, Policy Set. Give it a name and click Ok. You will be returned to the list of policy sets. Select your policy set and click Edit.      Now you can create the policies listed below to control all directions of traffic within the example environment. Click New and create the policies listed below:       Name Source Destination Service Action Log Allowed Traffic     BlockList-Inbound Russia all ALL DENY All Sessions   BlockList-Outbound all Russia ALL DENY All Sessions   HTTPS-Inbound UnitedStates RFC-1918 HTTPS ACCEPT All Sessions   ICMP-EastWest RFC-1918 RFC-1918 ALL_ICMP ACCEPT All Sessions   AuthSharedServices-EastWest ProdAPIBackend ProdAuthBackend HTTPS + RADIUS ACCEPT All Sessions     ICMP-Egress RFC-1918 UnitedStates ALL_ICMP ACCEPT All Sessions   IPinfo-Egress SDNGroup1 + SDNGroup2 + AppPublicSubnet1 + AppPublicSubnet2 ipinfo.io HTTPS ACCEPT All Sessions      In order to use this policy set, it must be applied to the deployed FortiGate CNF Instance. Navigate to CNF instances and select and edit the CNF Instance then click the Configure Policy Set bread crumb. In the Apply Policy Set, select your policy set then click Save then Finalize.      This concludes this section.    "
